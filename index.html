I gathered that the main point of the column was to challenge the accuracy of the scientific study of climate change based on the misconduct of a few individuals and to characterize this field as “highly secretive.” Starting with the first misconception summaries of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports are available online for anyone who cares to read them. Mhiripiri also plays the tune that climate change is a murky business and the science is not supported by clear evidence.  It’s true that certain details of climate change are complex and obscure but the larger picture is very simple and well understood.  Carbon dioxide is one of several gases that keeps in some of the Earth’s heat and makes it a livable temperature for humans.  Human activities have greatly increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to a point that exceeds by far anything in the last 650 thousand years.  Similar to adding another blanket this increase in carbon dioxide has and will continue to increase Earth’s average temperature.  As a result a great deal of polar ice will melt and thus raise the sea level.  Considering the large number of people who live very close to the current sea level this has catastrophic implications.  Just ask the residents of New Orleans how it was to have their city flooded.  Another result of this climate change will be increased desertification.  Farming a desert has never been easy especially now considering the increasing scarcity of fresh water.  The science is simple: global warming is real and is very bad news. It is important to ask questions and data manipulation is never acceptable but it is propagandistic to use this so-called scandal in an attempt to throw into doubt a thorough and empirically supported field of science.", "The Russian ambassador. A deputy prime minister. A pop star, a weightlifter, a lawyer, a Soviet army veteran with alleged intelligence ties. Again and again and again, over the course of Donald Trump’s 18-month campaign for the presidency, Russian citizens made contact with his closest family and friends, as well as figures on the periphery of his orbit. Some offered to help his campaign and his real estate business. Some offered dirt on his Democratic opponent. Repeatedly, Russian nationals suggested Trump should hold a peacemaking sit-down with Vladi­mir Putin — and offered to broker such a summit. In all, Russians interacted with at least 14 Trump associates during the campaign and presidential transition, public records and interviews show. “It is extremely unusual,” said Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama. “Both the number of contacts and the nature of the contacts are extraordinary.”As special counsel Robert S. Mueller III slowly unveils the evidence that he has gathered since his appointment in May 2017, he has not yet shown that any of the dozens of interactions between people in Trump’s orbit and Russians resulted in any specific coordination between his presidential campaign and Russia.", "SAN FRANCISCO — A dog that survived the catastrophic wildfire in Northern California apparently protected the ruins of his home for almost a month until his owner returned. Madison was there waiting when Andrea Gaylord was allowed back to check on her burned property in Paradise this week.Gaylord fled when the Nov. 8 fire broke out and decimated the town of 27,000. An animal rescuer who responded to Gaylord's request to check on Madison first spotted the male Anatolian shepherd mix several days later.Shayla Sullivan said the outdoor guard dog was apprehensive and kept his distance. Sullivan left food and water for him regularly until Gaylord got back on Wednesday.", "ATLANTA (AP) - Uber could owe tens of millions of dollars to Georgia if the state is successful in a legal battle.The Georgia Department of Revenue has billed Uber $22.1 million for sales taxes and other charges that it maintains are owed by the company.Ride-hailing services do not pay sales taxes in Georgia. But the department says they should under Georgia law.", "A Massachusetts family’s experience giving marijuana edibles to their dying patriarch is set to kick off a desperately needed investigation into how cannabis might treat some of the more troubling symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that affects 5.7 million Americans.Alexander Spier spent three years during the Holocaust in Auschwitz and other concentration camps as punishment not only for his heritage but also because he had fought against the Nazis with the Dutch Underground. Spier was eventually able to emigrate to the U.S. from Holland in 1945, where he began working as a watchmaker and jeweler before moving into real estate and construction. Today, Spier’s family runs the multimillion-dollar company that he built, Mayfair Realty & Development Corporation. They’ve also carried on his tradition of philanthropy through the Spier Family Foundation, which has supported a variety of medical research through different hospitals in the past.Harvard’s McLean Psychiatric Hospital is one of those institutions supported by the Spiers. And now, it’s partnering with the family to research the potential benefits of medical marijuana on Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia."];
